# TOGA's Stuff
A personal timewaster project that is a mod for Balatro.

[Download the latest public release here.](https://github.com/TheOneGoofAli/TOGAPackBalatro/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

Uses Steamodded 1.0.0-BETA and a few Lovely-based patches.
https://github.com/Steamodded/smods

Talisman 2.1.0 (development builds work too) is an optional dependency as of 1.0.2.
https://github.com/MathIsFun0/Talisman

_Please use the source code download options for grabbing the mod._ That way, I don't have to remake the 7z archive every single time.
